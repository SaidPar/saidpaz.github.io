My name is Said Pazirandeh. Growing up, I had a healthy dose of Nintendo, Lego's and graphing calculators. My first academic love is math, but I found my calling when I was introduced to SQL and relational database platforms. 

I currently work at Esri as a Principal Developor on the Knowledge team where we integrate graph analytics into the platform. The intersection of spatial & data access at scale has captured my attention since 2015.

I love spending time in nature with my wife and dog. I'm an avid rock climber, mountain biker, back country skier & paraglider.
